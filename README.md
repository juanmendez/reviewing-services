# Review Services

Each branch is a topic of working with Services in Android. I learned Services a while ago, but haven't used several features in a while, so I did these demos and included them with RxJava2.

What's in each branch:

  - 00.simple_service (plain service)
  - 01.bound_service (service using bound services)
  - 02.service_localBroadcastReceiver (service using local broadcastReceiver)
  - 03.service_connection (service using a bound connection)
  - 04.intentService_noReply (plain intent service, no response to Android component)
  - 05.intentService_resultReceiver (intent service responding with resultReceiver back to Android component)
  - *.master (This is an empty branch only having dependencies for the branches above)
