# Reviewing Services

Each branch is a topic of working with Services in Android. I learned Services a while ago, but haven't used several features in a while, so I did these demos and included them with RxJava2.

What's in each branch:

  - [00.simple_service (plain service)](https://github.com/juanmendez/reviewing-services/tree/00.simple_service)
  - [01.bound_service (service using bound services)](https://github.com/juanmendez/reviewing-services/tree/01.bound_service)
  - [02.service_localBroadcastReceiver (service using local broadcastReceiver)](https://github.com/juanmendez/reviewing-services/tree/02.service_localBroadcastReceiver)
  - [03.service_connection (service using a bound connection)](https://github.com/juanmendez/reviewing-services/tree/03.service_connection)
  - [04.intentService_noReply (plain intent service, no response to Android component)](https://github.com/juanmendez/reviewing-services/tree/04.intentService_noReply)
  - [05.intentService_resultReceiver (intent service responding with resultReceiver back to Android component)](https://github.com/juanmendez/reviewing-services/tree/05.intentService_resultReceiver)
  - *.master (This is an empty branch only having dependencies for the branches above)()
